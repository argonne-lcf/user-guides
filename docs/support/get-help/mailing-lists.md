# Mailing Lists

All notifications regarding system outages and preventative maintenance schedules are sent to appropriate system mailing lists. 

Users are auto-subscribed to the relevant system mailing list(s) when they **first** gain access to that system. The user's primary email is subscribed to the list(s).

You will need to re-subscribe if you either:

- Unsubscribed from the mailing list(s) and wish to rejoin, or
- Would like to subscribe a different email address instead

## Manual un/subscription

To manually subscribe or unsubscribe from an arbitrary `list-name`, go to:
```text
https://lists.alcf.anl.gov/mailman/listinfo/<list-name>-notify 
```
and follow the instructions. 

!!! warning

    You must replace `<list-name>` with an appropriate compute system you have access to (such as `polaris`, `crux`, `aurora`, `sophia`, etc.).
