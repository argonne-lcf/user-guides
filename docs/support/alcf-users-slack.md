# ALCF Users Slack Workspace

The ALCF Users Slack workspace is a platform intended for current, active ALCF users[^1] where the user community can interact, collaborate, and help one another. This workspace is a pilot program valid for 1 year. 
This workspace is a platform for the user community to interact and collaborate. ALCF staff may have a limited presence or not be present at all times to assist users with their queries. **The official mechanism for requesting support is to email [support@alcf.anl.gov](mailto:support@alcf.anl.gov) for technical issues and [accounts@alcf.anl.gov](mailto:accounts@alcf.anl.gov) for account and access-related issues.**

## Getting access

ALCF Users Slack access is automatically provided to members of INCITE, ALCC, and ESP projects. Certain (**see footnote**) DD projects[^1] can request Slack access for their teams by submitting a support ticket to [support@alcf.anl.gov](mailto:support@alcf.anl.gov). 

[^1]: ALCF users working on scientific or research campaigns across various allocation types are eligible for access to the ALCF Users Slack workspace. Users participating in training events, instructional courses, or lighthouse projects are **not** eligible for User slack access.

## Logging into Slack

ALCF Users Slack uses ALCF credentials for access. Active ALCF users who have beenÂ granted access should log in here: [https://alcf-users.slack.com](https://alcf-users.slack.com).

## Using Slack Channels

Once you are logged into the Slack workspace, your default channels will show up in the navigation pane. All system-specific announcements will be published on the `#announcements` channel. You can browse and join existing public channels or create private channels for your project. You can send direct messages to your collaborators. While you cannot create public channels, you can email [support@alcf.anl.gov](mailto:support@alcf.anl.gov) to request for one.

The ALCF User Slack workspace should not be used to discuss, store, or operate any NDA/RSNDA, Official Use Only (OUO), or Business Sensitive information.
