# Staying in Touch

ALCF uses several channels to share updates our facility and systems with users.   

## Mailing List Notifications

As a facility user, you will be added to our system notification mailing list. The mailing list will keep you up-to-date on machine maintenance, outages, and opportunities. Users are auto-subscribed to the relevant system mailing list(s) when they first gain access to that resource. You can unsubscribe from these notifications, although we recommend against doing so. You can learn more about your subscriptions at [Mailing Lists](./mailing-lists.md).

We send users a weekly newsletter on Fridays at 10 a.m. CT and a monthly facility newsletter. 

## System Statuses

You can check the current status of ALCF systems by logging in to MyALCF and checking the home screen dashboard. You can learn more about [MyALCF here](./MyALCF.md).

All system-specific announcements will also be published on the `#announcements` channel in the [ALCF Users Slack](./alcf-users-slack.md). 

## ALCF Support 

Our ALCF support team is available from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday - Friday, except on holidays. For technical assistance, you can reach the support team by submitting an email ticket to support@alcf.anl.gov. For account and access-related queries, you should submit a ticket to [accounts@alcf.anl.gov](mailto:accounts@alcf.anl.gov).

If you have an INCITE or ALCC allocation award, you can contact your Catalyst directly for project support.

## Training Events and Videos

ALCF offers workshops and webinars on various tools, systems, and frameworks. These hands-on training programs are designed to help PIs, project team members, and future users take advantage of the leadership-class computers available at ALCF and enhance the performance and productivity of their research. 

ALCF also collaborates with peer institutions and vendor partners to offer training that strengthens community competencies and promotes best practices.
