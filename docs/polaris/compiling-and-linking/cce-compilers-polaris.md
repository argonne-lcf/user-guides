# CCE Compilers on Polaris

The Cray Compiling Environment (CCE) compilers are available on Polaris via the `PrgEnv-cray` module. 

The CCE compilers currently on Polaris only support AMD GPU targets for HIP and are thus not usable with the A100 GPUs. 

[//]: # (ToDo: This needs to be confirmed. Man pages could be wrong.)

The `nvhpc` and `llvm` compilers can be used for compiling GPU-enabled applications.
