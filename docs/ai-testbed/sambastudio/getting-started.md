## Connecting to SambaStudio

### Connecting to SambaStudio through browser
To connect to the studio browser, first login to the sambanova login node from the local machine. 
```bash
ssh -D7777 <alcf_user_id>@sambanova.alcf.anl.gov
```
The SambaStudio web UI is at `https://metis.alcf.anl.gov/`

Todo: Add details for creating the proxy. 

Login for the SambaStudio web UI is with your ALCF username, and an MFA passcode for authentication - either an 8-digit passcode generated by an app on your mobile device (e.g. MobilePASS+) or a CRYPTOCard-generated passcode prefixed by a 4-digit pin.

You will need the web UI to get the API Authorization Key, even if otherwise scripting interactions.

### Connecting to SambaStudio through CLI
If you want to use the SambaStudio CLI, or the SambaStudio Python API, a SambaNova login node may be used. Those nodes have the required version of Python available. See [Log in to Login Node](../sambanova/getting-started.md/#log-in-to-login-node).

TODO Need a browser/cli/api to/from SambaStudio diagram here.
