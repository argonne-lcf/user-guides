## Connecting to SambaStudio

TODO Need a browser/cli/api to/from SambaStudio diagram here.

The SambaStudio web UI is at `https://metis.alcf.anl.gov/`

Login for the SambaStudio web UI is with your ALCF username, and an MFA passcode for authentication - either an 8-digit passcode generated by an app on your mobile device (e.g. MobilePASS+) or a CRYPTOCard-generated passcode prefixed by a 4-digit pin. This is the method used to authenticate into other ALCF systems, such as Polaris.

You will need the web UI to get the API Authorization Key, even if otherwise scripting interactions.
