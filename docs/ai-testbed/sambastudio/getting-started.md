## Connecting to SambaStudio

### Connecting to SambaStudio through browser

The SambaStudio web UI is at `https://metis.alcf.anl.gov/`

Login for the SambaStudio web UI is with your ALCF username, and an MFA passcode for authentication - either an 8-digit passcode generated by an app on your mobile device (e.g. MobilePASS+) or a CRYPTOCard-generated passcode prefixed by a 4-digit pin.

You will need the web UI to get the API Authorization Key, even if otherwise scripting interactions.

### Connecting to SambaStudio through CLI
For CLI instructions, see [CLI](running-a-model-or-program.md/#cli)

The SambaStudio CLI and the SambaStudio python API require python 3.9 or 3.10.

If your workstation has one of these python versions installed, it can be used. 

The login nodes for the SambaNova SD30 cluster also have required version of Python available, if you do not already have, or do not want to install, python 3.9 or 3.10.  See [Log in to Login Node](../sambanova/getting-started.md/#log-in-to-login-node).
