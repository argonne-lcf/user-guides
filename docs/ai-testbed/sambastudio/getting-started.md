## Connecting to SambaStudio


Need a browser/cli/api to/from SambaStudio diagram here.

Connection to the SambaStudio GUI requires an MFA passcode for authentication - either an 8-digit passcode generated by an app on your mobile device (e.g. MobilePASS+) or a CRYPTOCard-generated passcode prefixed by a 4-digit pin. This is the same passcode used to authenticate into other ALCF systems, such as Polaris.<br>

Once in the UI, you can copy endpoint urls and security tokens for use in application usages outside the GUI.
