## Connection to a CS-2 node

<!---These instructions presume that you have completed steps 1 and 2 on ALCFs

![CS-2 connection diagram](/files/Cerebras-connectivity-diagram.png)
Connection to a CS-2 node is a two step process. <br>
The first step requires a MFA passcode for authentication - either a 8 digit passcode generated by an app on your mobile device (e.g. mobilePASS+) or a CRYPTOCard-generated passcode prefixed by a 4 digit pin. This is the same passcode used to authenticate into other ALCF systems, such as Theta and Cooley.<br>
*In the examples below, <strong>replace ALCFUserID with your ALCF user id.</strong>*<br>
<!---[TODO the need for the second authentication step may be eliminated soon.]<br>--->
<!---[TODO testbed-cs2-01-med8.ai.alcf.anl.gov is not currently accessible]<br>--->
To connect to a CS-2 ("chief") node:<br>

1. From the local machine, ssh to the login node first: 
    ```bash
    ssh ALCFUserID@cerebras.alcf.anl.gov
    ```
2. From the login node, ssh to the destination CS-2 chief node:
    ```bash
    ssh cs2-01-master
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    ssh cs2-02-master
    ```

Alternatively, this maybe done in one command line from the local machine. (two passcodes required):
```console
ssh -o "ProxyJump ALCFUserID@cerebras.alcf.anl.gov" ALCFUserID@cs2-01-master
```
or
```console
ssh -o "ProxyJump ALCFUserID@cerebras.alcf.anl.gov" ALCFUserID@cs2-02-master
```

Verify that the connection was successful with
```bash
uname -a
```
and by making sure the output message contains `testbed-cs2-01-med1` or `testbed-cs2-02-med8`, and <strong>not</strong> `cs-login`.

<!--- This is now all set automatically
## Setup the environment

After ssh'ing to a CS-02 chief node,

```console
source /software/cerebras/cs2-02/envs/cs_env.sh
```

The contents of the `cs_env.sh script` is shown below.

```console
export PATH=$PATH:/software/cerebras/cs2-02/bin
export CS_IP=192.168.220.50
```
