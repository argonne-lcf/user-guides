Connection to one of the **CS-3** cluster login nodes requires an MFA passcode for authentication - an 8-digit passcode generated by an app on your mobile device (MobilePASS+). The same passcode system is used to authenticate into other ALCF systems, such as Polaris.<br>
*In the examples below, <strong>replace ALCFUserID with your ALCF user id.</strong>*<br>
To connect to a CS-3 login:<br>

ssh to a desired login node:
```bash
ssh ALCFUserID@cer-login-04.ai.alcf.anl.gov
```
or
```bash
ssh ALCFUserID@cer-login-05.ai.alcf.anl.gov
```

Then ssh to a cerebras user node:
```bash
ssh cer-anl-net001-us-sr01
```
or
```bash
ssh cer-anl-net001-us-sr02
```
