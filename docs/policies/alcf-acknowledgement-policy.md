# ALCF Acknowledgement Policy

As a U.S. Department of Energy user facility dedicated to the advancement of scientific discoveries, the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF) provides unique computing resources and expertise to a user community that is bound by certain policies designed to acknowledge and promote the work of others as well as the resources used to accomplish this work.

The ALCF requests your continued compliance with the terms of your program or discretionary award, specifically with regard to acknowledgments in publications and presentations based on work done with ALCF resources. Also, please forward your accepted publication citations to pubs@alcf.anl.gov.

## AI Testbeds Publication Guidance

To publish technical reports and research papers using the ALCF AI testbeds, we request you to provide us with a draft of your paper prior to submission by emailing a copy to us at [support@alcf.anl.gov](mailto:support@alcf.anl.gov). We will work closely with the AI testbed vendors to provide feedback in a timely manner. We strongly recommend you engage us and the vendors early and often in this process to help us facilitate your research objectives.

For guidance on acknowledgements, please see the following sample policies:

## ALCF Computer Resource Acknowledgement

Authors should acknowledge the ALCF in all publications and presentations that speak to work performed on ALCF resources.

### __INCITE ALCF Acknowledgement__

Users should acknowledge the ALCF in all publications and presentations that speak to INCITE work performed on ALCF resources this way:

* An award of computer time was provided by the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Innovative and Novel Computational Impact on Theory and Experiment (INCITE) Program. This research used resources from the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility, a U.S. DOE Office of Science user facility at Argonne National Laboratory, which is supported by the Office of Science of the U.S. DOE under Contract No. DE-AC02-06CH11357.

### __INCITE ALCF and OLCF Acknowledgement__

Users should acknowledge the ALCF and OLCF in all publications and presentations that speak to INCITE work performed on both ALCF and OLCF resources this way:

* An award of computer time was provided by the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Innovative and Novel Computational Impact on Theory and Experiment (INCITE) Program. This research used supporting resources at the Argonne and the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facilities. The Argonne Leadership Computing Facility at Argonne National Laboratory is supported by the Office of Science of the U.S. DOE under Contract No. DE-AC02-06CH11357. The Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory is supported by the Office of Science of the U.S. DOE under Contract No. DE-AC05-00OR22725.

### __ALCC ALCF Acknowledgement__

Users should acknowledge the ALCF in all publications and presentations that speak to ALCC work performed on both ALCF resources this way unless ALCC provides explicit instructions:

* An award of computer time was provided by the ASCR Leadership Computing Challenge (ALCC) program. This research used resources of the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility, which is a U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science User Facility operated under contract DE-AC02-06CH11357

### __Non-INCITE, Non-ALCC ALCF Acknowledgemt__

For Directors Disretionary, Early Science Program, or other computer allocations outside of INCITE or ALCC, use the following general acknowledgement in publications and presentations:

* This research used resources of the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility, which is a U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science User Facility operated under contract DE-AC02-06CH11357.

## ALCF Staff/Postdocs Effort Acknowledgement

Effort for ALCF staff (including CPS Catalyst team members) and postdocs funded by ALCF is distinct from ALCF computer hardware acknowledgement. 

### __Research-Grant Funded Effort__

If you are publishing a paper based on work you did funded by a research grant, acknowledge that effort according to the requirements of the funding agency and program.

### __ALCF Funded Effort__

If you are publishing a paper based on work you did funded by ALCF as a staff member or postdoc, acknowledge your effort this way:

* [NAME OR INITIALS] was supported by the Office of Science, U.S. Department of Energy, under contract DE-AC02-06CH11357.
