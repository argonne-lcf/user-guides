# Accounts and Access FAQ

## I am unable to sign in to the MyALCF portal. What do I do?
Only users with active ALCF accounts can sign in to the MyALCF user portal. If you have an active account, verify that you are using the correct ALCF username. Note that the username is case-sensitive. If you forgot your username, contact [support@alcf.anl.gov](mailto:support@alcf.anl.gov). For passcode token issues, please review the troubleshooting information on this page: [Passcode Tokens](https://docs.alcf.anl.gov/account-project-management/accounts-and-access/alcf-passcode-tokens/).

If your account is inactive, please submit a reactivation request here: [https://my.alcf.anl.gov/accounts/#/accountReactivate](https://my.alcf.anl.gov/accounts/#/accountReactivate).

If you never had an ALCF account, please apply for one here: [https://my.alcf.anl.gov/accounts/#/accountRequest](https://my.alcf.anl.gov/accounts/#/accountRequest). Note that all ALCF accounts must be associated with a project with an active allocation.

## How do I request a new project/allocation?

## What do I do when I receive a warning that my 593 is about to expire?
If you need to extend your access, follow the instructions in the email to update your USCIS information. After updating your information, forward the email to the PI/proxy listed in the email so they can send their approval to the ALCF Support team. Once we receive the approval, we will process the 593 (Foreign Visit & Assignment Request form) request.  In order to allow sufficient time for processing, it is recommended that your response be submitted as soon as possible. Processing time can range from a few days to a few weeks or months.

If you are not planning to extend your account, respond to the email letting us know so that we may close out your records.
