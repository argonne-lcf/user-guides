# ALCF User Account Overview

All computing carried out on the ALCF systems is associated with a user account. This account is used to log onto the servers and run jobs on ALCF resources. If someone has a user account, then they have a login name that is recorded in the user database. You can learn more about managing account details, as well as account policies and procedures here.

- If you need an account, visit the Accounts and Project Management website: [Request an account](https://my.alcf.anl.gov/accounts/#/accountRequest) 

## Getting an Account

To get an account on an ALCF resource, you must either request an allocation award or join a team that already has an allocation award. 

### Requesting an Allocation Award

If you are interested in having an account on an ALCF resource, you must first request an allocation. To learn more about allocation awards, please see [Allocations on ALCF Computing Resources](../../account-project-management/allocation-management.md).

When you request an account, please be prepared to provide:

- A detailed description of your project
- Computational requirements
- Coding capabilities for the applicable ALCF resources

### Joining a Team with an Allocation Award

New ALCF users will need to complete an account request. A project’s Principal Investigator (PI) must sponsor these accounts—if the PI is the user, an ALCF staff member must serve as sponsor. Sponsors are asked to review the accounts they sponsor on a yearly basis to determine whether or not those accounts should be kept active.

Project team members with existing accounts will need to be added to the project. Instructions for PIs to add team members can be found at [Managing Your Team Members](../../account-project-management/project-management/team-management.md).

## Account Abilities

A user with an active account can log in to the ALCF login servers (e.g., polaris.alcf.anl.gov). This account will have some home directory space, where file transfer can occur from that space via the login nodes. Development activities, such as editing and compiling, can also occur in that space.

## Account States

Accounts are classified in one of the following categories:

- **Pending:** An account that has been requested but has not yet been created.
- **Active:** An account that can be used to interact with the ALCF Login Servers. This is the normal state for all accounts.
- **Inactive:** An account that still exists on the system (that is, the account continues to be registered in the database and the user's files exist on disk) but the user cannot interact with the ALCF Login Servers. An account might be disabled due to misuse, security concerns, or because it is no longer allocated or the approval period has expired.
- **Deleted:** An account that existed on the system and is thus in the records and backups, but whose user no longer has access to the systems or files on disk. Typically, an account that is inactive for 90 days is flagged as deleted.
