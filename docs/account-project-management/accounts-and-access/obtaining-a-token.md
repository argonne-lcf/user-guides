# How to Obtain a Token

Users need to acquire a token to log in to ALCF systems. Users can choose between a Mobile **or** a Physical token.

!!! Note
  Please contact [accounts@alcf.anl.gov](mailto:accounts@alcf.anl.gov) to change your token preference.

- Mobile token:  Mobile tokens utilize an app that is keyed to your user account and for which you are responsible on your Android, iPhone, or Windows mobile device. Mobile tokens are a fast and easy way to get started quickly.
- Physical token: A physical token is a device that will be mailed to you. Once received, you will need to work with the ALCF support team to enable it.

## Mobile Token

The SafeNet MobilePass+ Mobile Token allows access to ALCF systems. This security mobile token uses one-time passwords combined with your PIN for controlled access to the login systems. The mobile token utilizes an app that is keyed to your user account. This app is maintained on your Android, iPhone, or Windows mobile device. 

Please safeguard your phone as you would your credit cards or house keys. Do not store your username, PIN, or other account-related records with the token. Sharing mobile tokens is strictly forbidden. A mobile token can be associated with a single device only.

### Step 1: Download the SafeNet MobilePass+ app for your device

The SafeNet MobilePASS+ app turns your device into a two-factor authentication device, removing the need to carry an additional hardware token. As a SafeNet MobilePASS+ user, you can generate passcodes on your mobile device and use those passcodes to authenticate on ALCF computing resources. For more details, please see the [SafeNet MobilePASS app information here](https://cpl.thalesgroup.com/access-management/authenticators/software-authentication/mobilepass-plus-push-authentication).

### Step 2: Enroll your MobilePass+ mobile token

After you’ve been provisioned a mobile token, you will receive a notification email with the subject line "ALCF Mobile Token Self-Enrollment”. You must access the enrollment from the device on which you wish to install the token. 

Users have the choice between auto-enrolling or manually enrolling their MobilePass+ Token.

#### Auto-Enrollment (to enroll SafeNet MobilePass+ token automatically):

1. You will receive a link to enroll in your email. Click on this link and the SafeNet Authentication Service Self-Enrollment will open.
2. Click enroll your SafeNet MobilePass+ token. 
3. When prompted to open in MobilePass+, tap **Open**.

7. Insert the desired name in the **Token Name** field or leave it as is. This name is not utilized by the server; it is for you only.
8. The newly enrolled SafeNet MobilePass+ token is now displayed in the SafeNet MobilePass+ app.

## Physical Token

The physical token allows access to the ALCF systems. This security token uses one-time passwords combined with your PIN for controlled access to the login systems. The physical token is a tracked asset for which you are responsible and is keyed to your use. 

Please safeguard your token as you would your credit cards or house keys. Do not store username, PIN, or other account-related records with the token. Sharing of physical tokens is strictly forbidden. Please do not mark on the token or alter it in any way.

### Activating Your ALCF Physical Token

You will receive your physical token in the mail. Upon receipt of the physical token, contact [accounts@alcf.anl.gov](mailto:accounts@alcf.anl.gov) to verify your identity and activate the token. If this step is not performed, you will not be able to use the passcode token to log on to the ALCF resource.
