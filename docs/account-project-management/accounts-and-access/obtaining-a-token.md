# How To Obtain a Token

Users need to acquire a token to log in to ALCF systems.
Users can choose between a Mobile or a Physical token.

Note: Please contact [accounts@alcf.anl.gov](mailto:accounts@alcf.anl.gov) to
change your token preference.

- [Mobile Token](#mobile-token): Mobile tokens utilize an app that is keyed to your user account
  and for which you are responsible on your Android, iPhone, or Windows mobile
  device.
  Mobile tokens are a fast and easy way to get started quickly.

- [Physical Token](#physical-token): A physical token is a device that will be mailed to you.
  Once received, you will need to work with the ALCF support team to enable it.

## Mobile Token

The SafeNet MobilePass+ Mobile Token allows access to ALCF systems.
This security mobile token uses one-time passwords combined with your PIN for
controlled access to the login systems.
The mobile token utilizes an app that is keyed to your user account.
This app is maintained on your Android, iPhone, or Windows mobile device.

Please safeguard your phone as you would your credit cards or house keys.

Do not store your username, PIN, or other account-related records with the
token.
Sharing mobile tokens is strictly forbidden.
A mobile token can be associated with a single device only.

### Step 1: Download the SafeNet MobilePass+ app for your device

The SafeNet MobilePASS+ app turns your device into a two-factor authentication
device, removing the need to carry an additional hardware token.

As a SafeNet MobilePASS+ user, you can generate passcodes on your mobile device
and use those passcodes to authenticate on ALCF computing resources.
For more details, please see the
[SafeNet MobilePASS app information here](https://cpl.thalesgroup.com/access-management/authenticators/software-authentication/mobilepass-plus-push-authentication).

### Step 2: Enroll your MobilePass+ mobile token

After you've been provisioned a mobile token, you will receive a notification
email with the subject line "ALCF Mobile Token Self-Enrollment".

You must access the enrollment from the device on which you wish to install the
token.

Users have the choice between auto-enrolling or manually enrolling their
MobilePass+ Token.

## Physical Token

The physical token allows access to the ALCF systems.

This security token uses one-time passwords combined with your PIN for
controlled access to the login systems.
The physical token is a tracked asset for which you are responsible and is
keyed to your use.

Please safeguard your token as you would your credit cards or house keys.
Do not store username, PIN, or other account-related records with the token.
Sharing of physical tokens is strictly forbidden.
Please do not mark on the token or alter it in any way.
