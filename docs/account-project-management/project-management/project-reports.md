# Quarterly and Year-End Reporting

The Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF) is required to report the progress and scientific accomplishments of all peer-reviewed projects.

PIs of INCITE, ALCC, and ADSP projects must complete quarterly reports and a final end-of-year (EOY) or end-of-project (EOP) report.

## Due dates

### 2025 INCITE quarterly, EOY, and EOP reports:

- April 1, 2025 (CY2025 - Q1)
- July 1, 2025 (CY2025 - Q2)
- October 1, 2025 (CY2025 - Q3)
- January 1, 2026 (CY2025 - EOY) or February 15, 2026 (entire allocation period - EOP)

### 2024-2025 / 2025-2026 ALCC EOP report:
- August 15, 2025 (CY2025)

### 2025-2026 ALCC quarterly and EOP reports:
- October 1, 2025 (CY2025 - Q3)
- January 1, 2026 (CY2025 - Q4)
- April 1, 2026 (CY2026 - Q1)

## Penalties

If a quarterly report is more than **30 days late**:

- The ability to submit jobs for the PI and users of the late project will be disabled.

If a quarterly report is more than **90 days late**:

- The PI and users of the late project will have their accounts disabled.

These penalties will be removed within three business days after the late quarterly or EOY report is submitted.

#### ALCC Specific Penalties:

A similar penalty will also be applied to new ALCC projects with the same PI or co-PIs that have failed to submit the EOP report for a previous ALCC project. If the EOP report is more than 15 days late:

- The new ALCC project will be blocked.
- For a currently active ALCC project,the ability to submit jobs for the project and all sub-projects will be disabled.
- For a project that has not been created yet, the process for new project creation will be halted.

## Appeals

A PI or user may appeal a project or account suspension to the ALCF Director by a request to [ALCF Support](mailto:support@alcf.anl.gov).

## Report Templates

Templates for the quarterly and the EOY reports can be found at the links at the bottom of this page.

Please modify the filename to reflect your project's details: 
- Replace PINAME with the last name of the PI of the INCITE/ALCC project
- Replace ALLOCATION with INCITE or ALCC 
- Replace YEAR to the corresponding calendar year

For example, for a project with PI 'Joe Smith' that is submitting the quarterly report for the first quarter in the 2023-2024 cycle for ALCC, the filename will be Smith_ALCC_Q1.docx.

- For an EOY report, replace YEARS with the years associated with your allocation.

For example, an ALCC 2025-2026 project with PI 'Joe Smith' would have a filename of Smith_ALCC_2025-2026_EOY.docx.
