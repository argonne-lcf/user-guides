# Allocations on ALCF Computing Resources

## Getting an Allocation Award
### INCITE and ALCC
Researchers gain access to ALCF systems for computational science and engineering projects—typically with awards of millions of core-hours—through competitive, peer-reviewed allocation programs supported by the DOE and Argonne. Our peer-reviewed award programs consist of the [INCITE](https://www.alcf.anl.gov/science/incite-allocation-program), and [ALCC](https://www.alcf.anl.gov/science/alcc-allocation-program) programs. More information about the programs, including dates for our CFPs, can be found on their web pages.

### Director's Discretionary 
Alternatively, ALCF offers a Director's Discretionary allocation award program for leadership computing preparation, INCITE and ALCC scaling, and application performance to maximize scientific application efficiency and productivity on leadership computing platforms. See the [Director's Discretionary (DD) Program page](https://www.alcf.anl.gov/science/directors-discretionary-allocation-program) for more information.

### NAIRR
In the NAIRR Pilot program, the US National Science Foundation (NSF), the US Department of Energy (DOE), and numerous private and non-profit sector partners are providing an opportunity for the research community to request access to a set of computing, model, platform and educational resources for projects related to advancing AI research. See [NAIRR](https://www.alcf.anl.gov/nairr-program) for more information.

## Initializing Your Awarded Allocation 
Projects with INCITE and ALCC awards will be contacted directly by the ALCF staff with information on creating accounts.

Director's Discretionary and NAIRR awardees will receive information in the award confirmation email. 

## Allocation Resources
Depending on the allocation program, users can choose from some or all of the following resources when requesting an allocation:

**Compute:**
* HPC Systems - Aurora, Polaris, Sophia, Crux
* AI Accelerators - Groq, Graphcore, SambaNova, Cerebras

**File System:** 
* Eagle (storage-only allocations)

## Requesting Additional Allocation Hours
If you are a PI of a Director's Discretionary project that has an active allocation, you can request additional time or an extension for your compute allocations using the [allocation request form](https://my.alcf.anl.gov/accounts/#/allocationRequests). To renew or extend storage allocations, see instructions [here](https://docs.alcf.anl.gov/account-project-management/accounts-and-access/accounts-and-access-faqs/#i-am-unable-to-sign-in-to-the-accounts-website-what-do-i-do)
