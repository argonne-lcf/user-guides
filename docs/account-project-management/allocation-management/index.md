# Allocations on ALCF Computing Resources

## Getting an Allocation Award
### INCITE and ALCC
Researchers gain access to ALCF systems for computational science and engineering projects—typically with awards of millions of core-hours—through competitive, peer-reviewed allocation programs supported by the DOE and Argonne. Our peer-reviewed award programs consist of the [INCITE](https://www.alcf.anl.gov/science/incite-allocation-program), and [ALCC](https://www.alcf.anl.gov/science/alcc-allocation-program) programs. More information about the programs, including dates for our CFPs, can be found on their web pages.

### Director's Discretionary 
ALCF offers a Director's Discretionary allocation award program for leadership computing preparation, INCITE and ALCC scaling, and application performance to maximize scientific application efficiency and productivity on leadership computing platforms. See the [Director's Discretionary (DD) Program page](https://www.alcf.anl.gov/science/directors-discretionary-allocation-program) for more information.

### NAIRR
In the NAIRR Pilot program, the US National Science Foundation (NSF), the US Department of Energy (DOE), and numerous private and non-profit sector partners are providing an opportunity for the research community to request access to a set of computing, model, platform and educational resources for projects related to advancing AI research. See [NAIRR](https://www.alcf.anl.gov/nairr-program) for more information.

## Initializing Your Awarded Allocation 
ALCF staff will directly contact INCITE and ALCC awardees with information on creating accounts.
