# sbank Allocation Accounting System
sbank is the accounting system used within the ALCF. It tracks project allocations, usage charges, and refunds. sbank allows queries about the balance and expiration of project allocations, and has replaced the outdated cbank accounting system.

The sbank accounting system helps users manage their allocations and usage per job. It gives the PIs the ability to monitor their allocation usage by user, job, and machine. It also allows the user to monitor their usage per allocation and provides insight on how many hours are left on the project.
