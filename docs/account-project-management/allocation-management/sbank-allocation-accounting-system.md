# sbank Allocation Accounting System

sbank (formerly cbank) is the accounting system used within the ALCF. sbank stores the transaction information for project allocations, usage charges, and refunds. ALCF users can query sbank about their allocations to find helpful information that will help to plan their workload and document activity.

Through sbank, project PIs can manage their allocation by monitoring usage by user, job, and machine. Individual users can monitor their usage per allocation or per job and see general allocation information such as available node hours or expiration dates.

## sbank Interface Options
sbank is available through a command line interface (see below for example commands and docs) or through a [graphic interface](https://my.alcf.anl.gov/ni/#/list/:command%3Dsbank-list-allocations) in the MyALCF user portal further explained in [MyALCF documentation.](../../account-project-management/MyALCF.md)
