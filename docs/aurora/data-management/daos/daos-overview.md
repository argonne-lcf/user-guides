# DAOS Architecture

DAOS is a major file system in Aurora with 230 PB delivering upto >30 TB/s with 1024 DAOS server storage Nodes. DAOS is an open-source software-defined object store designed for massively distributed Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) and NVMe SSD. DAOS presents a unified storage model with a native Key-array Value storage interface supporting POSIX, MPIO, DFS and HDF5. Users can use DAOS for their I/O and checkpointing on Aurora. DAOS is fully integrated with the wider Aurora compute fabric as can be seen in the overall storage architecture below.

## DAOS Overview

The first step in using DAOS is to get DAOS POOL space allocated for your project.
Users should submit a request as noted below to have a DAOS pool created for your project.

## DAOS Pool Allocation

DAOS pool is a physically allocated dedicated storage space for your project.

Email [support@alcf.anl.gov](mailto:support@alcf.anl.gov) to request a DAOS pool with the following information:

- Project Name
- ALCF User Names
- Total Space requested (typically 100 TBs++)
- Justification
- Preferred pool name

### Note

This is an initial test DAOS configuration and as such, any data on the DAOS system will eventually be deleted when the configuration is changed into a larger system. Warning will be given before the system is wiped to allow time for users to move any important data off.

## Modules

Please load the `daos` module when using DAOS. This should be done on the login node (UAN) or in the compute node (jobscript):

```bash linenums="1"
module use /soft/modulefiles
module load daos/base
```

## Pool

Pool is a dedicated space allocated to your project. Once your pool is allocated for your project space.

Confirm you are able to query the pool via:

```bash linenums="1"
daos pool query <pool_name>
```

```output title="Example output:"

```

## POSIX Containers

In DAOS general tems, a container is a logical space within a pool where data and metadata are stored. It's essentially a self-contained object namespace and versioning space.  There are several types of containers, but all of the focus in this guide and all future references will be on utilizing containers of the POSIX type in the context of the DAOS File System (DFS). DFS is essentially a POSIX emulation layer on top of DAOS and is implemented in the libdfs library, allowing a DAOS container to be accessed as a hierarchical POSIX namespace. libdfs supports files, directories, and symbolic links, but not hard links.  The DAOS official documention on DFS can be found [here](https://docs.daos.io/v2.6/user/filesystem).

With more than 1024 servers at full deployment, the user-accessible cluster named `daos_user` has 16,384 solid state drives (SSDs) and 16,384 persistent memory modules, and without some amount of data redundancy a hardware failure on any one could result in the loss of your data.  DAOS has several data redundancy options available, and a tradeoff must be made between data resiliency, performance, and volume.  The recommended tradeoff is to specify a redundancy factor of 2 on the container for both files and directories via the `rd_fac:2` container property.  By default, this means files will utilize an erasure coding algorithm with a ratio of 16 data blocks to 2 parity blocks (in DAOS file object class terms `EC_16P2GX`), which in simplest terms, means 18 blocks of erasure coding stores 16 blocks of data. For directories, the default is to create 2 full duplicates of the directory, which is basically an emulation of an inode in traditional file system terms, by setting the directory object class to `RP_3G1`. For this default setting, there is little performance tradeoff for directories at this redundancy level, since it just contains metadata.

In the scenario with the above settings, when a server failure occurs, be it a software or hardware failure (e.g. an SSD, persistent memory module, or a networking switch failure) on up to 2 servers, a process called a _rebuild_ occurs. During rebuild, the data on the failed servers is reconstructed to preserve data integrity, and the servers with the failures are excluded from the cluster. The servers or network can be repaired in the future so that the servers are eventually reintegrated to the cluster.  The rebuild process in this scenario does not disrupt service, and the cluster does not experience any outage.  If more than 2 servers are lost (say, due to a network issue) or more servers are lost during the rebuild, then the cluster will be taken offline to conduct repairs.

These parameters are set at container creation as follows along with others which will be described below for best practices:
```bash 
daos container create --type=POSIX  --chunk-size=2097152  --properties=rd_fac:2,ec_cell_sz:131072,cksum:crc32,srv_cksum:on <pool name> <container name>
```

The chunk-size of 2 MB and the `ec_cell_sz` (erasure coding cell size) of 128 KB work together to optimally stripe the data across the 16 data servers plus 2 parity servers (18 erasure coding servers) and set the amount of data written to an SSD on a server at one time by one client. The general rule of thumb is the number of data servers (excluding parity servers) multiplied by the `ec_cell_sz` should equal the chunk size, or at least be an even multiple of it.  DAOS containers have a property for both server and client checksum, whereby the client will retry the data transfer to or from the server in the case of corruption, however by default this is disabled, to enable it for best performance and acceptable accuracy usage of the CRC-32 algorithm is recommended with the above parameters `cksum:crc32,srv_cksum:on`.

Now, the `GX` in `EC_16P2GX` tells the container to stripe the data across all servers in the pool, which is optimum if your application is writing a single shared file, but instead if your application is writing many files, say file per process, for best performance you should change the `GX` to `G32`, the 32 being the hard-coded number of servers the data in the file will be striped across.  You can do this in one of two ways:

1. Use the `--file-oclass` parameter explicitly in the container creation. The call would look like:
```bash
daos container create --type=POSIX  --chunk-size=2097152 --file-oclass=EC_16P2G32  --properties=rd_fac:2,ec_cell_sz:131072,cksum:crc32,srv_cksum:on <pool name> <container name>
```
2. Create a subdirectory in the container and set the attribute on it. For example, if your container was created with `EC_16P2GX` and you wanted a subdirectory `<dir name>` to have `EC_16P2G32`, mount the container (this is described in the 'Mount a POSIX container' section below) with directory `<dir name>` at `/tmp/<pool name>/<container name>` and then:
```bash
daos fs set-attr --path=/tmp/<pool name>/<container name>/<dir name> --oclass=EC_16P2G32
```
By default any top-level directory created in a container will inherit the directory and file object class from the container, and any subdirectory inherits from its parent, so in this fashion you can change the default and have a mix of file object classes in the same container.

There is maintenance overhead with containers, therefore it is advisable to create just one or a few containers and create multiple directories in the few containers to partition your work.

## DAOS sanity checks

If any of the following command results in an error, then you can confirm DAOS is currently down.
'Out of group or member list' error is an exception and can be safely ignored. This error message will be fixed in the next DAOS release.

```bash
module use /soft/modulefiles
module load daos/base
env | grep DRPC
ps –ef | grep daos
clush --hostfile ${PBS_NODEFILE} ps –ef | grep agent | grep -v grep'  | dshbak -c     #to check on all compute nodes
export DAOS_POOL=Your_allocated_pool_name
daos pool query ${DAOS_POOL}
daos cont list ${DAOS_POOL}
daos container get-prop  $DAOS_POOL  $DAOS_CONT
```

- Look for messages like `Rebuild busy and state degraded in the daos pool query.`
- Look for messages like `Health (status) : UNCLEAN in the get prop`

```bash
daos pool      autotest  $DAOS_POOL
daos container check --pool=$DAOS_POOL --cont=$DAOS_CONT
```

### Mount a POSIX container

Currently, you must manually mount your container prior to use on any node you are working on.
In the future, we hope to automate some of this via additional `qsub` options.

#### To mount a POSIX container on a login node

```bash linenums="1"
mkdir -p /tmp/${USER}/${DAOS_POOL}/${DAOS_CONT}
start-dfuse.sh -m /tmp/${USER}/${DAOS_POOL}/${DAOS_CONT} --pool ${DAOS_POOL} --cont ${DAOS_CONT} # To mount
mount | grep dfuse # To confirm if its mounted

# Mode 1
ls /tmp/${USER}/${DAOS_POOL}/${DAOS_CONT}
cd /tmp/${USER}/${DAOS_POOL}/${DAOS_CONT}
cp ~/temp.txt ~ /tmp/${USER}/${DAOS_POOL}/${DAOS_CONT}/
cat /tmp/${USER}/${DAOS_POOL}/${DAOS_CONT}/temp.txt

fusermount3 -u /tmp/${USER}/${DAOS_POOL}/${DAOS_CONT} # To unmount
```

#### To mount a POSIX container on Compute Nodes

You need to mount the container on all compute nodes.

```bash linenums="1"
launch-dfuse.sh ${DAOS_POOL}:${DAOS_CONT} # launched using pdsh on all compute nodes mounted at: /tmp/<pool>/<container>
mount | grep dfuse # To confirm if its mounted

ls /tmp/${DAOS_POOL}/${DAOS_CONT}/

clean-dfuse.sh  ${DAOS_POOL}:${DAOS_CONT} # To unmount on all nodes
```

DAOS Data mover instruction is provided at [here](../moving_data_to_aurora/daos_datamover.md).

To optimize performance, you may need to copy the contents of `launch-dfuse.sh`, add `-o multi-user`, enable caching, and then use the updated file to mount the container.

## Job Submission

The `-l filesystems=daos_user` switch will ensure that DAOS is accessible on the compute nodes.

Job submission without requesting DAOS:

```bash
# replace `./pbs_script1.sh` with `-I` for an interactive job
qsub -l select=1 -l walltime=01:00:00 -A <ProjectName> -k doe -l filesystems=flare -q debug ./pbs_script1.sh
```

Job submission with DAOS:

```bash
qsub -l select=1 -l walltime=01:00:00 -A <ProjectName> -k doe -l filesystems=flare:daos_user -q debug ./pbs_script1.sh
```

## NIC and Core Binding

Each Aurora compute node has 8 NICs and each DAOS server node has 2 NICs. Each NIC is capable of driving 20-25 GB/s unidirection for data transfer. Every read and write goes over the NIC and hence NIC binding is the key to achieve good performance.

For 12 PPN, the following binding is recommended:

```bash
CPU_BINDING1=list:4:9:14:19:20:25:56:61:66:71:74:79
```

## Interception library for POSIX containers

The interception library (IL) is a next step in improving DAOS performance. This provides kernel-bypass for I/O data, leading to improved performance. The `libioil` IL will intercept basic read and write POSIX calls while all metadata calls still go through dFuse. The `libpil4dfs` IL should be used for both data and metadata calls to go through dFuse.

The IL can provide a large performance improvement for bulk I/O as it bypasses the kernel and commuNICates with DAOS directly in userspace. It will also take advantage of the multiple NICs on the node based on how many MPI processes are running on the node and which CPU socket they are on.

![Interception library](images/interception.png "Interception library")

```bash linenums="1" title="Interception library for POSIX mode"
mpiexec                                            # no interception
mpiexec --env LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib64/libioil.so     # only data is intercepted
mpiexec --env LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib64/libpil4dfs.so  # preferred - both metadata and data is intercepted. This provides close to DFS mode performance.
```

## Sample job script

Currently, `--no-vni` is required in the `mpiexec` command to use DAOS.

## MPI-IO Container Access

The MPICH MPI-IO layer on Aurora (ROMIO) provides multiple I/O backends including one for DAOS. ROMIO can be used with dFuse and the interception library utilizing the UFS backend, but the DAOS backend will provide optimal performance. By default ROMIO will auto-detect DFS and use the DAOS backend.   MPI-IO itself is a common backend for many I/O libraries, including HDF5 and PNetCDF.  Whether using collective I/O MPI-IO calls directly or indirectly via an I/O library, a  process called collective buffering can be done where data from small non-contiguous chunks across many compute nodes in the collective is aggregated into larger contiguous buffers on a few compute nodes, referred to as aggregators, from which DFS API calls are made to write to or read from DAOS.  Collective buffering can improve or degrade I/O performance depending on the I/O pattern, and in the case of DAOS, disabling it can lead to I/O failures in some cases, where the I/O traffic directly from all the compute nodes in the collective to DAOS is too stressful in the form of extreme numbers of small non-contiguous data reads and writes.  In ROMIO there are hints that should be set to either optimally enable or disable collective buffering.  At this time you should explicitly enable collective buffering in the most optimal fashion, as disabling it or allowing it to default to disabled could result in I/O failures.  To optimally enable collective buffering, create a file with the following contents:
```bash 
romio_cb_write enable
romio_cb_read enable
cb_buffer_size 16777216
cb_config_list *:8
striping_unit 2097152
```

Then simply set the following environment variable at run time to point to it:
```bash 
export ROMIO_HINTS=<path to hints file>
```

If you want to verify the settings, additionally set:
```bash 
export ROMIO_PRINT_HINTS=1
```

Which will print out all the ROMIO hints at run time.

## DFS Container Access

DFS is the user level API for DAOS. This API is very similar to POSIX but still has many differences that would require code changes to utilize DFS directly. The DFS API can provide the best overall performance for any scenario other than workloads which benefit from caching.

```c linenums="1" title="Reference code for using DAOS through DFS mode and DAOS APIs"
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <mpi.h>
#include <daos.h>
#include <daos_fs.h>
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    dfs_t *dfs;
    d_iov_t global;
    ret = MPI_Init(&argc, &argv);
    ret = MPI_Comm_rank(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &rank);
    ret = dfs_init();
    ret = dfs_connect(getenv("DAOS_POOL"), NULL, getenv("DAOS_CONT"), O_RDWR, NULL, &dfs);
    ret = dfs_open(dfs, NULL, filename, S_IFREG|S_IRUSR|S_IWUSR,  O_CREAT|O_WRONLY,  obj_class, chunk_size, NULL, &obj);
    ret = dfs_write(dfs, obj, &sgl, off, NULL);
    ret = dfs_read(dfs, obj, &sgl, off, &read, NULL);
    ret = dfs_disconnect(dfs);
    ret = daos_fini();
    ret = MPI_Finalize();
}
```

The full code is available on the Aurora filesystem within `/soft/daos/examples/src/`

## Darshan profiler for DAOS

Darshan is a lightweight I/O profiling tool consisting of a shared library your application preloads at runtime which generates a binary log file at program termination, and a suite of utilities to analyze this file.  Full official documentation can be found [here](https://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/darshan/documentation/).

On Aurora, Darshan has been built in the programming environment in `/soft`, however it has not yet been fully modularized so the shared library must be manually preloaded at run time via `LD_PRELOAD`, along with PNetCDF and HDF5 shared libraries since support for those I/O libraries is included, and all 3 must precede any DAOS interception library, so the specification would be:
```bash 
LD_PRELOAD=/soft/perftools/darshan/darshan-3.4.7/lib/libdarshan.so:/opt/aurora/24.347.0/spack/unified/0.9.2/install/linux-sles15-x86_64/oneapi-2025.0.5/hdf5-1.14.5-zrlo32i/lib/libhdf5.so:/opt/aurora/24.347.0/spack/unified/0.9.2/install/linux-sles15-x86_64/oneapi-2025.0.5/parallel-netcdf-1.12.3-cszcp66/lib/libpnetcdf.so:/usr/lib64/libpil4dfs.so
```

If your application is using `gpu_tile_compact.sh` then this whole `LD_PRELOAD` will go in your personal copy of the Bash script via the `export` builtin command.  This generated binary log file now has two additional modules: DFS for the DAOS file system API layer, and DAOS for the underlying object store.  By default, the binary log file is stored here:
```bash 
/lus/flare/logs/darshan/aurora/YYYY/M/D
```

where the last 3 directories are the date the file is generated, with your user ID, job ID and timestamp in the file name.  Alternatively, at run time you can specify the file name to be saved with a specified name in a different location with the following environment variable:
```bash
export DARSHAN_LOGFILE=<full path to binary file name>
```

To get the Darshan utilities loaded into your programming environment, execute the following:
```bash 
module use /soft/perftools/darshan/darshan-3.4.7/share/craype-2.x/modulefiles
module load darshan
```

Then for example you could run the Darshan parser on the binany log file to get a text output of all the metrics as follows:
```bash 
darshan-parser <binary log file>  >  <text analysis file>
```

For generating a graphical summary report, it is recommended to use the PyDarshan module on Aurora. It is a simple process of creating and activating a Python environment, installing the Darshan package, and then running the summary report generation command:
```bash 
module load python
mkdir <pyton env dir>
python -m venv <pyton env dir>
cd <pyton env dir>
source bin/activate
pip install darshan
python -m darshan summary <binary log file>
```

The summary report is an `.html` file generated by default in the directory from which you ran Python. For help with interpreting these reports and analyzing your I/O pattern, feel free to contact Paul Coffman on the ALCF Performance Engineering Team via email: [pcoffman@anl.gov](mailto:pcoffman@anl.gov).

## Cluster Size

DAOS cluster size is the number of available DAOS servers. While we are working towards bringing up the entire 1024 DAOS server available users, currently different number of DAOS nodes could be up. Please check with support or run an IOR test to get an estimate on the current number of DAOS servers available. The bandwidth listed here in the last column is a theoretical peak bandwidth.

**Expected Bandwidth** Expected number of DAOS servers and its approximate expected bandwidth

| Nodes | Percentage | Throughput |
| :---: | :--------: | :--------: |
|  20   |     2%     |   1 TB/s   |
|  128  |   12.50%   |   5 TB/s   |
|  600  |    60%     |  10 TB/s   |
|  800  |    78%     |  20 TB/s   |
| 1024  |    100%    |  30 TB/s   |

## Libfabric endpoint creation error

Occasionally at a high number of nodes and/or high PPN the following error that looks like this may show up in your stderr log:

You can disregard this, as the DAOS client will simply retry the operation until it succeeds.

## Issue with the `gpu_tile_compact.sh` bash script and the DAOS Interception Libraries

There is currently a bug between the oneAPI Level Zero, the DAOS Interception Libraries (/usr/lib64/libpil4dfs.so and /usr/lib64/libioil.so) and the /soft/tools/mpi_wrapper_utils/gpu_tile_compact.sh bash script where you may get an error like this sporadically at scale:
```bash 
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::invalid_argument'
  what():  stoul
/soft/tools/mpi_wrapper_utils/gpu_tile_compact.sh: line 47: 38240 Aborted                 "$@"
x4616c3s4b0n0.hostmgmt2616.cm.aurora.alcf.anl.gov: rank 2355 exited with code 134
x4616c3s4b0n0.hostmgmt2616.cm.aurora.alcf.anl.gov: rank 2358 died from signal 15
```

This issue is still under investigation, in the mean time there is a workaround which is to take the `/soft/tools/mpi_wrapper_utils/gpu_tile_compact.sh` Bash script and create your own version of it to do the `LD_PRELOAD` of the interception library within this script, so in the case of the `libpil4dfs.so` adding the line:
```bash 
export LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib64/libpil4dfs.so
```
(just before the execution of the binary). For an example, see: 
```bash 
/lus/flare/projects/Aurora_deployment/pkcoff/scripts/gpu_tile_compact_LD_PRELOAD.sh
```

## Best practices

1. Check that you **requested** DAOS:

    ```bash
    qsub –l filesystems=daos_user
    ```

1. Check that you **loaded** the DAOS module:

    ```bash
    module load daos
    ```

1. Check that you have your DAOS pool **allocated**:

    ```bash
    daos pool query datascience
    ```

1. Check that the DAOS client is **running** on all your nodes:

    ```bash
    ps -ef | grep daos
    ```

1. Check that your container is **mounted** on all nodes:

    ```bash
    mount | grep dfuse
    ```

1. Check that you **can `ls`** in your container:

    ```bash
    ls /tmp/${DAOS_POOL}/${DAOS_CONT}
    ```

1. Check that your I/O **actually failed**.

1. Check the **health property** in your container:

    ```bash
    daos container get-prop $DAOS_POOL $CONT
    ```

1. Check if your space is **full** (min and max):

    ```bash
    daos pool query datascience
    ```

1. Check if your query shows **failed targets** or **rebuild in process**:

    ```bash
    daos pool query datascience
    ```

1. Run the following commands to **check the health** of your DAOS pool and container:

    ```bash
    daos pool autotest
    daos container check
    ```
