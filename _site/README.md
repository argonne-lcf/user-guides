## Contributing to documentation

### Python environment

To build documentation locally, you need a Python environment with `mkdocs` installed.  Check that Python 3.6+ is installed:
```bash
python --version
```
e.g. `Python 3.8.3`. Then create a new virtual env to isolate the `mkdocs` installation:
```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

### Git

Using Git's SSH protocol. Make sure you add your SSH public key to your GitHub account:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:argonne-lcf/user-guides.git
cd user-guides
git submodule init; git submodule update
```

### Installing MkDocs

To install `mkdocs` in the current environment: 
```bash
cd user-guides
make install-dev
```

### Preview the docs locally and test for errors

Run `mkdocs serve` or `make serve` to auto-build and serve the docs for preview in your web browser:
```bash
make serve
```

GitHub Actions are used to automatically validate all changes in pull requests before they are merged, by executing `mkdocs build --strict`. The [`--strict`](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/configuration/#validation) flag will print out warnings and return a nonzero code if any of a number of checks fail (e.g. broken relative links, orphaned Markdown pages that are missing from the navigation sidebar, etc.). To see if your changes will pass these tests, run the following command locally:
```
make build-docs
```

### Working on documentation

* All commits must have a commit message
* Create your own branch from the `main` branch.  Here, we are using `YOURBRANCH` as an example:
```bash
cd user-guides
git fetch --all
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b YOURBRANCH
git push -u origin YOURBRANCH
```
* Commit your changes to the remote repo:
```bash
cd user-guides
git status                         # check the status of the files you have edited
git commit -a -m "Updated docs"    # preferably one issue per commit
git status                         # should say working tree clean
git push origin YOURBRANCH         # push YOURBRANCH to origin
git checkout main                  # move to the local main
git pull origin main               # pull the remote main to your local machine
git checkout YOURBRANCH            # move back to your local branch
git merge main                     # merge the local develop into **YOURBRANCH** and
                                     # make sure NO merge conflicts exist
git push origin YOURBRANCH         # push the changes from local branch up to your remote branch
```
* Create merge request from https://github.com/argonne-lcf/user-guides from `YOURBRANCH` to `main` branch.
