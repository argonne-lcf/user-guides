# Getting Started on Polaris

## Logging Into Polaris

To log into Polaris:
```bash
ssh <username>@polaris.alcf.anl.gov
```
Then, type in the password from your CRYPTOCard/MobilePASS+ token.

## Hardware Overview

An overview of the Polaris system, including details on the compute node architecture, is available on the [Machine Overview](./hardware-overview/machine-overview.md) page.

## Compiling Applications

Users are encouraged to read through the [Compiling and Linking Overview](./compiling-and-linking/compiling-and-linking-overview.md) page and corresponding pages depending on the target compiler and programming model.

## Accessing Additional Software

In addition to the Cray PE, ALCF installs software in `/soft`, which can be accessed via module commands by altering your `$MODULEPATH`:
```bash
module use /soft/modulefiles
```
The available software can then be queried with `module avail`.

Additionally, a suite of software packages is provided via Spack deployments, detailed on the [Spack PE](./applications-and-libraries/libraries/spack-pe.md) page.

## Submitting and Running Jobs

Users are encouraged to read through the [Running Jobs with PBS at the ALCF](../running-jobs/job-and-queue-scheduling.md) page for information on using the PBS scheduler and preparing job submission scripts. Some example job submission scripts are available on the [Example Job Scripts](../running-jobs/example-job-scripts.md) page as well.

## Proxy

If the node you are on doesnâ€™t have outbound network connectivity, add the following to your `~/.bash_profile` file to access the proxy host:

```bash
# proxy settings
export HTTP_PROXY="http://proxy.alcf.anl.gov:3128"
export HTTPS_PROXY="http://proxy.alcf.anl.gov:3128"
export http_proxy="http://proxy.alcf.anl.gov:3128"
export https_proxy="http://proxy.alcf.anl.gov:3128"
export ftp_proxy="http://proxy.alcf.anl.gov:3128"
export no_proxy="admin,polaris-adminvm-01,localhost,*.cm.polaris.alcf.anl.gov,polaris-*,*.polaris.alcf.anl.gov,*.alcf.anl.gov"
```
