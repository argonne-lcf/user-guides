## QMCPACK on Polaris

[QMCPACK](https://qmcpack.org/) is a modern high-performance open-source Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulation code. Its main applications are electronic structure calculations of molecular, quasi-2D, and solid-state systems. Variational Monte Carlo (VMC), diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC), and a number of other advanced QMC algorithms are implemented. Orbital space auxiliary field QMC (AFQMC) has recently been added. By directly solving the Schr√∂dinger equation, QMC methods offer greater accuracy than methods such as density functional theory, but at the trade-off of much greater computational expense.

Prebuilt executables are provided at `/soft/applications/qmcpack`. The directory of each installation also includes a job submission script example `qmcpack-polaris.job`. An updated build recipe is provided on [GitHub](https://github.com/QMCPACK/qmcpack/blob/develop/config/build_alcf_polaris_Clang.sh).
