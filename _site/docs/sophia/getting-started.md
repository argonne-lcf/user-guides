# Getting Started on Sophia

## Logging Into Sophia

To log into Sophia:
```bash
ssh <username>@sophia.alcf.anl.gov
```
Then, type in the password from your CRYPTOCard/MobilePASS+ token. Once logged in, you land on one of the Sophia login nodes (sophia-login-01, sophia-login-02).

## Hardware Overview

An overview of the Sophia system, including details on the compute node architecture, is available on the [Machine Overview](./hardware-overview/machine-overview.md) page.

## Compiling Applications

For all code building and development, please use Sophia compute nodes. Please read through the [Compiling and Linking Overview](./compiling-and-linking/compiling-and-linking-overview.md) page and corresponding pages depending on the target compiler and programming model.

## Accessing Additional Software

ALCF installs additional software in `/soft`, which can be accessed via module commands by altering your `$MODULEPATH`:
```bash
module use /soft/modulefiles
```
The available software can then be queried with `module avail`.

## Submitting and Running Jobs

Please read through the [Running Jobs with PBS at the ALCF](../running-jobs/job-and-queue-scheduling.md) page for information on using the PBS scheduler and preparing job submission scripts.

For more information on Sophia queues and job submission, visit: [Running Jobs on Sophia](./queueing-and-running-jobs/running-jobs.md).

## Proxy

If the node you are on doesnâ€™t have outbound network connectivity, add the following to your `~/.bash_profile` file to access the proxy host:

```bash
# proxy settings
export HTTP_PROXY="http://proxy.alcf.anl.gov:3128"
export HTTPS_PROXY="http://proxy.alcf.anl.gov:3128"
export http_proxy="http://proxy.alcf.anl.gov:3128"
export https_proxy="http://proxy.alcf.anl.gov:3128"
export ftp_proxy="http://proxy.alcf.anl.gov:3128"
```
