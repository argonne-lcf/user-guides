# Compiling and Linking on Sophia

## Overview
Sophia has AMD processors on the login nodes (`sophia-login-01,02`) and AMD processors and NVIDIA A100 GPUs on the compute nodes (see [Machine Overview](../hardware-overview/machine-overview.md) page). The login nodes can be used to create containers and launch jobs.

!!! warning inline end "Must compile on a compute node" 
    
    Until the cross-compiling environment is set up or dedicated build nodes are added, the compute nodes will have to be used for compiling. Do not compile codes on the login nodes. To launch an interactive job and acquire a compute node for compiling, use:

```bash
qsub -I -l select=1 -l walltime=HH:MM:SS -q by-gpu -A <myProjectName> -l filesystems=home:eagle
```

The default programming environment on the Sophia compute nodes is the GNU compiler tools coupled with NVIDIAâ€™s CUDA toolkit.

For non-GPU codes:

- `gcc`
- `g++`
- `gfortran`

For CUDA codes, please note that there is a new driver (v470) and default CUDA toolkit (v12.4):

- `nvcc`

The default Nvidia installed software will be in your PATH on compute nodes (not on login nodes).

```bash
which nvcc
```

***NEEDS UPDATING: everything from here down:***

For MPI, the latest MPI is in `/usr/mpi/gcc/openmpi-4.1.5a1`:

- `mpicc`
- `mpicxx`/`mpic++`/`mpiCC`
- `mpifort`/`mpif77`/`mpif90`

On the login nodes, GNU compilers are available.

## Modules on Sophia
Available modules can be listed via the command:

```bash
module avail
```

Loaded modules in your environment can be listed via the command:

```bash
module list
```

To load new modules, use:

```bash
module load <module_name>
```

**Usage:** csh and zsh users do not have to do anything special to their environments. Bash users, however, will need to add the following to any job scripts:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
. /etc/profile
```

Bash users are also encouraged to modify their `~/.bashrc` to ensure the Ubuntu system `/etc/bash.bashrc` file is sourced properly:

```bash
# Source global definitions
if [ -f /etc/bashrc ]
then
    . /etc/bashrc
elif [ -f /etc/bash.bashrc ]
then
    . /etc/bash.bashrc
fi
```
