# GPyTorch on Aurora

## 1. Login and Queue a Job

Login to Aurora:

```bash
ssh <username>@aurora.alcf.anl.gov
```

Refer to [Getting Started on Aurora](../../getting-started-on-aurora.md) for additional information. In particular, you need to set the environment variables that provide access to the proxy host.

!!! note

    The instructions below should be **run directly from a compute node**.

    Explicitly, to request an interactive job (from `aurora-uan`):

    ```bash
    qsub -I -q <your_Queue> -l select=1,walltime=60:00 -A <your_ProjectName> -l filesystems=<fs1:fs2>
    ```

    Refer to [job scheduling and execution](../../../running-jobs/index.md) for additional information.

## 2. Once on a Compute Node, Load Modules

```bash
module use /soft/modulefiles
module load frameworks
python3 -m venv --system-site-packages env_gpytorch
source env_gpytorch/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install gpytorch
```

#### Optional

Create an `activation_env.sh` file that contains the following lines:

```bash
module use /soft/modulefiles
module load frameworks
source env_gpytorch/bin/activate
```

and run `source activation_env.sh` to activate your environment for subsequent runs.

## 3. Running on GPUs

To run on GPUs, add the following to your code:

```python
import intel_extension_for_pytorch as ipex
```

Set the device as follows in the code:

```python
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    device = torch.device('cuda')
elif torch.xpu.is_available():
    device = torch.device('xpu')
else: 
    device = torch.device('cpu')
```

(You might need to install an earlier version of GPyTorch for multiple GPU usage.)
