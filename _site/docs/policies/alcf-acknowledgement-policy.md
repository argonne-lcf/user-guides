# ALCF Acknowledgement Policy

As a U.S. Department of Energy user facility dedicated to the advancement of scientific discoveries, the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF) provides unique computing resources and expertise to a user community that is bound by certain policies designed to acknowledge and promote the work of others as well as the resources used to accomplish this work.

The ALCF requests your continued compliance with the terms of your program or discretionary award, specifically with regard to acknowledgments in publications and presentations based on work done with ALCF resources. Also, please forward your accepted publication citations to pubs@alcf.anl.gov.

## AI Testbeds Publication Guidance

To publish technical reports and research papers using the ALCF AI testbeds, we request you to provide us with a draft of your paper prior to submission by emailing a copy to us at [support@alcf.anl.gov](mailto:support@alcf.anl.gov). We will work closely with the AI testbed vendors to provide feedback in a timely manner. We strongly recommend you engage us and the vendors early and often in this process to help us facilitate your research objectives.

For guidance on acknowledgements, please see the following sample policies:
