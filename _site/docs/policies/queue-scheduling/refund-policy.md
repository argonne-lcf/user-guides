# Refund Policy

If a system problem affects your run, ALCF will consider a refund of node hours. The ALCF expects all applications to regularly checkpoint, so refunds are typically capped at four hours of runtime for the affected job, unless the problem in question prevented checkpoints.

ALCF strongly advises against symlinking between filesystems or hard-coding paths to a different filesystem.

To request a refund, send the following information to [support@alcf.anl.gov](mailto:support@alcf.anl.gov):
- Job ID
- Machine
- Reason for refund request
