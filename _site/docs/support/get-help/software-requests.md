# Software Requests

!!! warning

    Software install requests can take several months to receive approval before testing and installation. Therefore, it is strongly encouraged to attempt to install the app yourself before contacting support for it to be installed system-wide.

If you want to request a package be installed on Polaris or Aurora, please email [support@alcf.anl.gov](mailto:support@alcf.anl.gov) and include the following:

* A link to the package/app you want to be installed
* The reason you need the package installed
* Why the currently provided applications/modules will not work for your workflow (if applicable)
