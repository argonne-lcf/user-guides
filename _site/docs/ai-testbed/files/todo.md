## CosmicTagger v1.x

> **Note**: Conversion of CT to the various machines is meant to be a tutorial as to how
to convert a model.

### Cerebras CT

Cerebras cannot support CT and UNets in general as of 4/25/23.

### Graphcore CT

Alex has been very busy with conferences, etc.

He ran CT but, it ran on the CPU.  He has stated that it may need to be completely written
using, I can't remember which, Poplar or PopArt.  If that is necessary, Venkat should
make the call.
