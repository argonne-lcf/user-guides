# Managing Your Allocations

Allocations require management – balance checks, resource allocation, requesting more time, etc.

## Checking for an Active Allocation

To determine if there is an active allocation, check [Job Submission](../../running-jobs/job-and-queue-scheduling.md#qsub).

For information on how to run the query, look at our documentation on our [sbank Allocations Accounting System](sbank-allocation-accounting-system.md) or email [support@alcf.anl.gov](mailto:support@alcf.anl.gov) and ask for all active allocations.

## Using sbank to Determine the Balance of an Allocation

To determine which platforms have an active balance, check our allocation accounting system [sbank](sbank-allocation-accounting-system.md).

- To obtain the allocation balance, check the `sbank` command [sbank-list-allocations](not_in_nav/sbank-list-allocations.md).
- DD projects with a negative balance will not be able to run jobs until they have requested additional time; see the "Getting More Time" subsection below.
- INCITE and ALCC PIs automatically receive an email summary of project usage. If this is a DD project, please email [support@alcf.anl.gov](mailto:support@alcf.anl.gov).

## Allocation Expiration

Projects and allocations at the ALCF are different. A particular project might have multiple allocations of time. For example, a discretionary project that has been approved more than three times will have three allocations
(two are probably expired) but just one project. Projects will not expire -- allocations will. If allocations are expired, or have no hours left, jobs will not be able to run. Consult the two above sections
to determine active allocations.

## Getting More Time

To request an extension of your existing discretionary allocation or to request additional hours, please email [support@alcf.anl.gov](mailto:support@alcf.anl.gov) with answers to the following:

- What have you accomplished with your original allocation?
- Please include a brief description of any publications or major presentations that were (or will be) generated in full or in part because of this allocation.
- What will you do with the extra time?
- What are you requesting as your new expiration date?
- How many additional hours are you requesting?

## Sub-allocations

!!! tip inline end

    See `sbank new suballocation -h` for all the options.

Suballocations let PIs control who in their team can run jobs, how much they are allowed to consume (allocation amount), and when they are allowed to run jobs (start and end dates).

**Step 1: Create Suballocations (Project PI):**

PI creates suballocations 

```bash
sbank new sub <allocationid> --name <nameofsuballoc>
```

**Step 2: Manage Suballocations (Project PI)**

PI adds users to suballocations

```bash
sbank e sub <projectname>::<nameofsuballoc> --add-user="<username1> <username2> ..."
```

PI can change the name of a suballocation 

```bash
sbank e sub <suballocationID> --name=<new_name_of_suballocation>
```

By default, the primary suballocation (which is the default suballocation created when the allocation is created by ALCF) is unrestricted, i.e., enabled for all project members. That means all project members can submit jobs against the primary suballocation by default. All other suballocations are restricted by default, and users have to be added for each of them.

To change the default for the primary suballocation to restrict usage, PI must first edit the suballocation:

```bash
sbank-edit-suballocation --restrict <primary suballocation id>
```

Then add users with this command:

```bash
sbank e sub <primary suballocation id> --add-user="<username1> <username2> ..."
```

PI changes start and end dates for a suballocation:

```bash
sbank e sub <suballocationID> -S <start_date> -E <end_date>
```

PI adds hours to a suballocation:

```bash
sbank e sub <projectname>::<nameOfSourceSuballoc> --hours-to-move <hours> --to-suballocation <projectname>::<nameOfDestSuballoc>
```

!!! note

    `hours` must be less than or equal to the available balance for the suballocation `nameOfSourceSuballoc`.

!!! tip inline end

    See `sbank e suballocation -h` for all the options.

**Step 3: Submit Jobs (Project team)**

Submit jobs to a suballocation. Note that the user should be on the suballocation’s user list.

Example:

```bash
qsub -l select=10,walltime=30:00,filesystems=eagle:home -A <suballocationID> -q demand test.sh
```

Note: Once submanagement is enabled for a project allocation, all job submissions must specify the `suballocationID`.

**Useful commands:**

List all suballocations for a project that shows the number of jobs run, charges, allocation balance, suballocation name, and list of users:

```bash
sbank-list-allocations -r polaris -p <projectname> -f "+subname users_list"
```

!!! tip 

    See `sbank l a -h` for all the options and `sbank –f\?` for a list of fields that can be displayed.
