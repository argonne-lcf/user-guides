## What do I do when my ALCF account expires?
Please forward your account expiry email to your Sponsor. As soon as we receive an approval email from your Sponsor, we'll proceed with your account renewal process as needed.

## What do I do when I receive a warning that my 593 has expired / is about to expire?
If you are planning to extend this assignment/computer user account, please let us know, so a new 593 (Foreign Visit & Assignment Request form) will be filed for you using the information from before. In case any other documents are needed from your end, you'll be contacted as necessary. In order to allow sufficient time for an indices check, it is recommended that your response be submitted as soon as possible.

If you are not planning to extend your account, also let us know so that we may close out your records.
