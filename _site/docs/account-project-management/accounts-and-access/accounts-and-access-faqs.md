# Accounts and Access FAQ

## I am unable to sign in to the MyALCF portal. What do I do?
Only users with active ALCF accounts can sign in to the MyALCF user portal. If you have an active account, verify that you are using the correct ALCF username. Note that the username is case-sensitive. If you forgot your username, contact [support@alcf.anl.gov](mailto:support@alcf.anl.gov). 

For passcode, this is your ALCF Cryptocard (PIN+passcode string displayed) or Mobilepass+ token (passcode from the app). For passcode token issues, please review the troubleshooting information on this page: [Troubleshooting Tokens](./troubleshooting-tokens.md). 

If your account is inactive, please submit a reactivation request [here](https://my.alcf.anl.gov/accounts/#/accountReactivate).

If you never had an ALCF account, please apply for one [here](https://my.alcf.anl.gov/accounts/#/accountRequest). Note that all ALCF accounts must be associated with a project with an active allocation.

## How do I request a new project/allocation?
Please see [Allocations on ALCF Systems](../allocation-management/index.md)

## Who do I contact if my Discretionary Project Allocation expires or if I need to request additional hours?
To renew or request an extension or request additional hours for your existing compute allocations, please fill out the [Allocation Request Form](https://my.alcf.anl.gov/accounts/#/allocationRequests). 

For storage-allocation renewals/extensions/quota increases, email [support@alcf.anl.gov](mailto:support@alcf.anl.gov) with answers to the following:
- What have you accomplished with your original allocation?
  - Please include a brief description of any publications or major presentations that were (or will be) generated in full or in part because of this allocation.
- What will you do with the extra time?
- How much additional storage (in TB) do you need?

## How do I apply for a new account?

## What do I do when I receive a warning that my 593 is about to expire?
If you need to extend your access, follow the instructions in the email to update your USCIS information. After updating your information, forward the email to the PI/proxy listed in the email so they can send their approval to the ALCF Support team. Once we receive the approval, we will process the 593 (Foreign Visit & Assignment Request form) request.  In order to allow sufficient time for processing, it is recommended that your response be submitted as soon as possible. Processing time can range from a few days to a few weeks or months.

If you are not planning to extend your account, respond to the email letting us know so that we may close out your records.
