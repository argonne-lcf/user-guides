The cluster contains four CS-3 wafer scale engines (compute nodes), supported by 4 worker nodes, 4 activation servers, 2 sets of 12 MemoryX, and 8 SwarmX nodes. The memoryX nodes(24 in total) are grouped into 2 seperate node groups, 12 nodes, each of 1128Gi configuration used for serving large models up to 200B, and the smaller models use the other set of MemoryX configured with 12 nodes each of 183Gi capacity.</p> <p>The Cerebras Wafer-Scale cluster is run as an appliance: a user submits a job to the appliance, and the appliance manages preprocessing and streaming of the data, IO, and device orchestration within the appliance. It provides programming via PyTorch. This installation supports Weight Streaming execution for models being pre-trained or fine-tuned.</p> <p>The public Cerebras documentation is available here.</p> <p>A typical Cerebras Wafer-Scale Cluster is shown in the figure below.

Alternative versions of the Aurora PE, as well as Aurora PE components not loaded by default, are available through the module interface. Each version of the PE may have multiple compilers, runtimes, and/or MPICH installations which are interchangeable via modules. In addition to the OneAPI and MPICH installations, the Aurora PE contains the Spack PE, a software stack which includes general-purpose and scientific computing packages. See the Spack PE page for more details.</p>"},{"location":"aurora/aurora-pe/#switching-pe-or-sdk-versions","title":"Switching PE or SDK versions","text":"<p>Aurora PE and OneAPI SDK versions can be viewed with <code>module avail</code> and switched with <code>module load</code> commands. The Aurora PE modules utilize Lmod's hierarchical module system to allow seamless switching between versions of the Aurora PE and its components. For example, if the user loads a different version of the <code>oneapi</code> module, other loaded modules from the Aurora PE, such as <code>intel_compute_runtime</code>, <code>mpich</code>, and packages from the Spack PE, will be reloaded to guarantee compatibility. In short, the hierarchical modulefile system ensures that the module environment is self-consistent with minimal user intervention.</p>"},{"location":"aurora/aurora-pe/#aurora-pe-and-soft","title":"Aurora PE and /soft","text":"<p>The Aurora PE is installed in <code>/opt/aurora</code> and is mounted as a read-only squashfs. <code>/soft</code> is also available to provide software not present in the Aurora PE. However, loading libraries from shared filesystems like <code>/soft</code> can cause performance issues at scale. Modules in <code>/soft/modulefiles</code> are not part of the default environment in order to avoid adverse impacts. Users wishing to use software in <code>/soft</code> will need to first run <code>module use /soft/modulefiles</code> to access the modules.</p> <p>The Aurora PE has a longer-term upgrade cadence (on the order of months), so ad-hoc software requests will be fulfilled through software installations in <code>/soft</code>. <code>/soft</code> installations will be considered for incorporation into the Aurora PE during upgrade cycles.</p> <p>Modules in <code>/soft</code> may conflict with modules in the Aurora PE. Lmod has some limitations in automatically handling module conflicts, so the user may need to manually resolve conflicts arising from modules outside of the Aurora PE. Users are also advised to sanitize module paths that they add from other non-standard locations, such as <code>/home</code>, to avoid conflicts.</p>"},{"location":"aurora/bugs-table/","title":"Bugs table","text":"<p>&lt; Back to Aurora Known Issues page</p> <p>Sync tables now</p>"},{"location":"aurora/bugs-table/#open-issues","title":"Open Issues","text":"Internal ID Description Vendor ID Reproducer Path PoC Priority?

If you wanted a specific rack or Dragonfly group instead of any of them, you can use:</p> <pre><code>qsub -l select=10:tier0=x4519 -l place=scatter:group=tier0 pbs_submit_script.sh # allocating 10 nodes in rack x4519\nqsub -l select=2:tier1=x4519c2 -l place=scatter:group=tier1 pbs_submit_script.sh # allocating 2 nodes in rack x4519 chassis c2\n</code></pre> <p>Another example that requests 10 nodes (8 unspecified nodes + 2 specific compute nodes) would use: <pre><code>#PBS -l select=8:tier1=x4000c0+1:host=x4311c1s0b0n0+1:host=x4311c1s1b0n0\n</code></pre></p> <p>You can also easily check what tier a node is a member of before your job submission:</p> <pre><code>&gt; pbsnodes x4000c0s0b0n0 | grep tier\nresources_available.tier0 = x4000\nresources_available.tier1 = x4000c0\n</code></pre> <p>To check if a specific node is available:</p> <pre><code>&gt; pbsnodes -Sv &lt;node&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Another useful shell function for querying the compute node IDs and statuses available in a given <code>at_queue</code> (use <code>lustre_scaling</code>) and (optionally) matching status type <code>{free, job-exclusive, down}</code>: <pre><code>pbsnodes_queue() {\n  local at_queue=\"${1}\"\n  local state=\"${2:-}\"\n\n  if [ -z \"${state}\" ]; then\n    pbsnodes -avF JSON | jq --arg queue \"${at_queue}\" -r '.nodes[] | select(.resources_available.at_queue|split(\",\")|.[]|contains($queue)) | [.resources_available.vnode,.state,.comment]|join(\",\")'\n  else\n    pbsnodes -avF JSON | jq --arg queue \"${at_queue}\" --arg state \"${state}\" -r '.nodes[] | select(.resources_available.at_queue|split(\",\")|.[]|contains($queue))|select(.state == $state) | [.resources_available.vnode,.state,.comment]|join(\",\")'\n  fi\n}\n</code></pre> If this shell function is defined (e.g. in your local <code>~/.bashrc</code>), you can see the nodes that are currently <code>down</code> for example: <pre><code>\u276f pbsnodes_queue lustre_scaling down\nx4713c3s2b0n0,down,\nx4013c0s7b0n0,down,EXECJOB_BEGIN: RECHECK 1/40 grand mdc disconnect threshold exceeded(3/10min) (job 2471003)\nx4703c6s4b0n0,down,\nx4703c7s4b0n0,down,EXECJOB_END: RECHECK 2/40 grand mdc disconnect threshold exceeded(3/10min) (job 1070810)\nx4210c2s1b0n0,down,node down: communication closed\n</code></pre></p> <ol> <li> <p>Theoretical max node count.

There are several types of containers, but all of the focus in this guide and all future references will be on utilizing containers of the POSIX type in the context of the DAOS File System (DFS). DFS is essentially a POSIX emulation layer on top of DAOS and is implemented in the libdfs library, allowing a DAOS container to be accessed as a hierarchical POSIX namespace. libdfs supports files, directories, and symbolic links, but not hard links.  The DAOS official documentation on DFS can be found here.</p> <p>With more than 1024 servers at full deployment, the user-accessible cluster named <code>daos_user</code> has 16,384 solid state drives (SSDs) and 16,384 persistent memory modules, and without some amount of data redundancy a hardware failure on any one could result in the loss of your data.  DAOS has several data redundancy options available, and a tradeoff must be made between data resiliency, performance, and volume.  The recommended tradeoff is to specify a redundancy factor of 3 on the container for both files and directories via the <code>rd_fac:3</code> container property.  By default, this means files will utilize an erasure coding algorithm with a ratio of 16 data blocks to 3 parity blocks (in DAOS file object class terms <code>EC_16P3GX</code>), which in simplest terms, means 19 blocks of erasure coding stores 16 blocks of data. For directories, the default is to create 3 full duplicates of the directory, which is basically an emulation of an inode in traditional file system terms, by setting the directory object class to <code>RP_4G1</code>. For this default setting, there is little performance tradeoff for directories at this redundancy level, since it just contains metadata.</p> <p>In the scenario with the above settings, when a server failure occurs, be it a software or hardware failure (e.g. an SSD, persistent memory module, or a networking switch failure) on up to 3 servers, a process called a rebuild occurs. During rebuild, the data on the failed servers is reconstructed to preserve data integrity, and the servers with the failures are excluded from the cluster. The servers or network can be repaired in the future so that the servers are eventually reintegrated to the cluster.  The rebuild process in this scenario does not disrupt service, and the cluster does not experience any outage.  If more than 3 servers are lost (say, due to a network issue) or more servers are lost during the rebuild, then the cluster will be taken offline to conduct repairs.</p> <p>These parameters are set at container creation as follows along with others which will be described below for best practices: <pre><code>daos container create --type=POSIX  --chunk-size=2097152  --properties=rd_fac:3,ec_cell_sz:131072,cksum:crc32,srv_cksum:on --file-oclass=EC_16P3GX --dir-oclass=RP_4G1 &lt;pool name&gt; &lt;container name&gt;\n</code></pre></p> <p>The chunk-size of 2 MB and the <code>ec_cell_sz</code> (erasure coding cell size) of 128 KB work together to optimally stripe the data across the 16 data servers plus 3 parity servers (19 erasure coding servers) and set the maximum amount of data written to one SSD on one server by one client per transaction to the <code>ec_cell_sz</code> of 128 KB. The general rule of thumb is the chunk-size should equal the number of data servers (excluding parity servers) multiplied by the <code>ec_cell_sz</code> or at least be an even multiple of it.  If your application does large amounts of IO per process, you could experiment with the settings by increasing them proportionately, e.g. setting the chunk-size to 16 MB and the <code>ec_cell_sz</code> to 1 MB.  DAOS containers have a property for both server and client checksum, whereby the client will retry the data transfer to or from the server in the case of corruption, however by default this is disabled, to enable it for best performance and acceptable accuracy usage of the CRC-32 algorithm is recommended with the above parameters <code>cksum:crc32,srv_cksum:on</code>.</p> <p>Now, the <code>GX</code> in <code>EC_16P3GX</code> tells the container to stripe the data across all servers in the pool, which is optimum if your application is writing a single shared file or at most one file per node, but instead if your application is writing more than one file per node, say file per process, for best performance you should change the <code>GX</code> to <code>G32</code>, the 32 being the hard-coded number of servers the data in the file will be striped across.  You can do this in one of two ways:</p> <ol> <li>Use the <code>--file-oclass</code> parameter explicitly in the container creation. The call would look like: <pre><code>daos container create --type=POSIX  --chunk-size=2097152 --file-oclass=EC_16P3G32 --dir-oclass=RP_4G1 --properties=rd_fac:3,ec_cell_sz:131072,cksum:crc32,srv_cksum:on &lt;pool name&gt; &lt;container name&gt;\n</code></pre></li> <li>Create a subdirectory in the container and set the attribute on it. For example, if your container was created with <code>EC_16P3GX</code> and you wanted a subdirectory <code>&lt;dir name&gt;</code> to have <code>EC_16P3G32</code>, mount the container (this is described in the POSIX Container Access via DFUSE section below) with directory <code>&lt;dir name&gt;</code> at <code>/tmp/&lt;pool name&gt;/&lt;container name&gt;</code> and then: <pre><code>daos fs set-attr --path=/tmp/&lt;pool name&gt;/&lt;container name&gt;/&lt;dir name&gt; --oclass=EC_16P3G32\n</code></pre> By default any top-level directory created in a container will inherit the directory and file object class from the container, and any subdirectory inherits from its parent, so in this fashion you can change the default and have a mix of file object classes in the same container.</li> </ol> <p>There is maintenance overhead with containers, therefore it is advisable to create just one or a few containers and create multiple directories in the few containers to partition your work.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"aurora/data-management/daos/daos-overview/#daos-agent-check","title":"DAOS Agent Check","text":"<p>Whether you are accessing DAOS when running a job from a compute node or managing data from a login node, the DAOS agent daemon is needed to connect the DAOS client to the DAOS server cluster, in your case <code>daos_user</code>.

Notice that, these cores are picked out from the last 12 cores of each  socket (CPU), aligned with oneCCL default core picking strategy. 42-47 belongs  to the first socket, and 94-99 belongs to the second socket. We leave a few  cores free, in case, the user may want to use other services like copper and DAOS along with their application.

The key is that it provides access to GPU threads, not just CPU threads.

The GPU threads look like the last line in this example output, in which 2.481 is a single GPU thread id running on that GPU.

Who can create groups?</p> <p>A PI (and an Access Manager) can create new groups, add members to them, and share a guest collection with a group of collaborators. For more information, refer to: Creating a group</p> <p>12. What happens when the PI of a project changes? What happens to the guest collection endpoint?</p> <p>The new PI will need to create new guest collections and share it with collaborators again. Guest collections are tied to a PI's account and cannot be transferred.</p> <p>13. I noticed that I am the owner of all the files that were transferred by external collaborators using the guest collection. Why is that?</p> <p>When collaborators read files from or write files to the guest collection, they do so on behalf of the PI. All writes show up as having been carried by the PI. Additionally, if the PI does not have permission to read or write to a file or folder in the directory, then the collaborators will not have those permissions either.</p> <p>14. What happens to the guest collections when the PI's account goes inactive?</p> <p>The collections go inactive and will remain in that state until the PI's account is re-activated, provided it is done within 3 months.</p> <p>15.

This could be an entire host, or a nodeboard or a blade. A single host can be made up of multiple vnodes. Each vnode can be managed and scheduled independently. Each vnode in a complex must have a unique name. Vnodes on a host can share resources, such as node-locked licenses. PBS operates on vnodes. A vnode can, and in ALCF often will, represent an entire host, but it doesn't have to. For instance, there is a mode on Polaris where we could have each physical host look like four vnodes, each with 16 threads, 1/4 of the RAM and one A100.</p> <p><code>ncpus</code> :   Number of resources available to execute a program.

You use the <code>-l</code> option to specify job wide resources, i.e. <code>-l walltime=06:00:00</code>. All the resources in the job have the same walltime.</li> <li><code>-l &lt;resource name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;[,&lt;resource name&gt;=&lt;value&gt; ...]</code></li> <li>Chunks: (see the definition above) This is how you describe what your needs are to run your job. You do this with the <code>-l select=</code> syntax. In the ALCF, we do whole node scheduling and every node has a resource called <code>system</code> which is set to the system name it belongs to (Polaris, Aurora, etc). This means you can typically get away with the very simple <code>-l select=128:system=foo</code> which will give you 128 complete nodes on system foo.</li> <li><code>-l select=[&lt;N&gt;:]&lt;chunk&gt;[+[&lt;N&gt;:]&lt;chunk&gt; ...]</code> where N specifies how many of that chunk and a chunk is of the form:</li> <li><code>&lt;resource name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;[:&lt;resource name&gt;=&lt;value&gt; ...]</code></li> <li>Here is a hypothetical example that would select resources with A100s and other resources with A40 GPUs. PBS takes care of co-scheduling the nodes on the two systems for you transparently. Note that in this case since we did not specify <code>system=</code> if there were multiple systems that could satisfy a chunk you wouldn't know ahead of time which system you would get.</li> </ul> <p><code>-l select=128:ncpus=64:ngpus=4:gputype=A100+32:ncpus=64:ngpus=2:gputype=A40</code></p> <p>You also have to tell PBS how you want the chunks distributed across the physical hardware. You do that via the <code>-l place</code> option:</p> <ul> <li><code>-l place=[&lt;arrangement&gt;][: &lt;sharing&gt; ][: &lt;grouping&gt;]</code> where</li> <li>arrangement is one of <code>free | pack | scatter | vscatter</code><ul> <li>unless you have a specific reason to do otherwise, you probably want to set this to <code>scatter</code>, otherwise you may not get what you expect. For instance on a host with ncpus=64, if you requested <code>-l select=8:ncpus=8</code> you could end up with all of our chunks on one node.</li> <li><code>free</code> means PBS can distribute them as it sees fit</li> <li><code>pack</code> means all chunks from one host. Note that this is not the minimum number of hosts, it is one host. If the chunks can't fit on one host, the qsub will fail.</li> <li><code>scatter</code> means take only one chunk from any given host.</li> <li><code>vscatter</code> means take only one chunk from any given vnode. If a host has multiple vnodes, you could end up with more than one chunk on the host.</li> </ul> </li> <li>sharing is one of <code>excl | shared | exclhost</code> where<ul> <li>NOTE: Node configuration can override your requested sharing mode. For instance, in most cases ALCF sets the nodes to <code>force_exclhost</code>, so normally you don't have to specify this.</li> <li><code>excl</code> means this job gets the entire vnode</li> <li><code>shared</code> means the vnode could be shared with another job from another user.</li> <li><code>exclhost</code> means this job gets the entire host, even if it has multiple vnodes.</li> </ul> </li> <li>group=<code>&lt;resource name&gt;</code><ul> <li>As an example, for machines that use a dragonfly network topology, we provide a PBS resource named <code>tier1</code> indicating which dragonfly group a node is in. If you wanted to ensure that all the chunks came from a single dragonfly group, you could specify <code>place=group=tier1</code> as part of your qsub. <code>tier0</code> is rack granularity, so <code>group=tier0</code> would ensure your nodes all came from one rack. Note that if you requested more nodes than were available in a rack your job would never run and you would see something like <code>Not Running: Insufficient amount of resource: tier0</code>.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>We have defined placement sets for the tier0 and tier1 resources. As a result, if you don't specify a grouping PBS will preferentially group your nodes in a placement set, but it won't drain or delay your job start to do so. For example, if you request 10 nodes and don't specify a grouping, if 10 nodes are available in the same rack, all your nodes will be in one rack. If not, but there are 10 nodes in a single dragonfly group, all your nodes will be in one dragonfly group. If you wish to specify a specific rack or dragonfly group, that is accomplished via the select syntax. For instance, <code>qsub ... -l select=10:tier1=g0</code> would force your 10 nodes to be in dragonfly group 0.</p> <p>Here is a heavily commented sample PBS submission script that shows some more of the options, but remember that the PBS manuals referenced at the top of this page are the ultimate resource.</p> <pre><code>#!/bin/bash -l\n# UG Section 2.5, page UG-24 Job Submission Options\n# Add another # at the beginning of the line to comment out a line\n# NOTE: adding a switch to the command line will override values in this file.\n\n# These options are MANDATORY at ALCF; Your qsub will fail if you don't provide them.\n#PBS -A &lt;short project name&gt;\n#PBS -l walltime=HH:MM:SS\n#file systems used by the job\n#PBS -l filesystems=home:eagle\n\n\n# Highly recommended\n# The first 15 characters of the job name are displayed in the qstat output:\n#PBS -N &lt;name&gt;\n\n# If you need a queue other than the default, which is prod (uncomment to use)\n##PBS -q &lt;queue name&gt;\n\n# Controlling the output of your application\n# UG Sec 3.3 page UG-42 Managing Output and Error Files\n# By default, PBS spools your output on the compute node and then uses scp to move it the\n# destination directory after the job finishes.

<p>More information on creating custom Python environments can be found in our documentation for Polaris.</p> <p>After activating the custom environment, the <code>ipykernel</code> package needs to be installed with the following command:</p> <pre><code>pip install ipykernel\n</code></pre> <p>Once <code>ipykernel</code> is installed, the custom kernel can be added to the list of available kernels

appear in the kernel list.</p> <p>This name does not have to match the name of the environment, but should not contain spaces.</p> <p>If you want more flexibility in naming, you can add the

terminal, ideally on the login node of the system you're using.</p> <p>After setting up a custom kernel, you can easily add more packages directly within JupyterHub.</p> <p>Simply create a new notebook using your custom kernel and use the <code>%pip</code> or <code>%conda</code> magic commands to install packages.</p> <p>If you're on a compute node, remember to enable internet access by
